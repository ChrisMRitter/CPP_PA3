#This game is a basic implementation of a Galaga-inspired 2D sidescroller shooter where the player has to stop an alien invasion.
 Aliens deal damage over time if a collision with the player is detected, so don't let them touch you, they can destroy the player within a few seconds (especially the big ones).
 The larger aliens are motherships, they deal more damage, are harder to destroy, and give more points.
 Player moves side to side but can shoot in 360 degrees, enemies have free movement within the gameplay window.

 Press Spacebar to Shoot, A and D keys to move. Aim the laser with mouse/trackpad
